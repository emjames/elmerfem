! The solution of a magnetostatic problem by using the consistently regularized 
! formulation (to ensure a unique vector potential solution). See also the 
! alternate test mgdyn_bh_gauge2 for using a potentially more effective linear 
! solver.  
!
! The consistently regularized formulation employs the scalar variable as 
! an augmented Lagrangian variable to impose the divergence-free constraint on A. 
! The uniqueness of the vector potential can also be enforced in an iterated
! manner without introducing a coupled system to solve A and the scalar 
! variable. For this alternative see the file with_projection.sif.
